(Assume that student grades are between 1 to 20)

* Create a program that counts how many multiples of 3 exists between 0 and a number defined by the user, then print the multiples.

* Create a program that receives 2 numbers and print them from highest to lowest (if possible).

* Create a program to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle knowing the  lengths of its legs.

* Create a program that receives 3 numbers and stores them in 3 variables A, B y C respectively. The program should print the highest and the lowest number. The 3 numbers MUST be different, otherwise the program should show an alert.
